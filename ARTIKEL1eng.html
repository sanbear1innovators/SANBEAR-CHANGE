<h1>Climate Crisis 2024: Global Average Temperature Rise Threatens the Future</h1>
<p>The latest BMKG report reveals shocking facts about the rise in global temperatures.</p>
</header>

  <div class="container">
<p>Did you know that 2024 was one of the hottest years ever recorded by the BMKG? The BMKG recently released an article stating that in 2024 the global average temperature increased by 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels. Previously, the Paris Agreement agreed to by countries around the world limited the increase in the global average temperature to 2°C. This temperature increase indicates that the earth's temperature is getting closer to the agreed threshold. This condition could indicate a lack of global efforts to reduce global warming, which causes climate change.</p>
<p>In this modern era, the high use of electricity and fossil fuel-powered vehicles is one of the main causes of climate change. Data from the Association of Indonesian Automotive Industries (GAKINDO) states that the number of vehicles in Indonesia has reached 147 million private vehicles. The high number of private vehicles is caused by a vehicle that should be able to accommodate more than 3 people, only being filled by one person. This leads to high carbon emissions from motor vehicles. Not only that, some power plants in the world still rely on fossil fuels, where the combustion produces carbon emissions that cause the greenhouse effect.</p>

<div class="quote-box">“Carbon emissions are rising as fossil fuel use increases. Without global action, temperature rises will spiral out of control.”</div>
<p>Nevertheless, various concrete steps have been taken to reduce carbon emissions. One such step is the widespread use of carbon-free electric vehicles. This initiative has been implemented in various parts of the world, including Indonesia. However, this measure will not be effective if the power plants used remain fossil-fueled. Therefore, several alternatives such as solar, hydro, and air-powered power plants are also being implemented.</p>
<p>To prevent further increases in the Earth's average temperature, cooperation between governments and schools worldwide is needed. With international efforts, carbon emissions can be significantly reduced and the Earth's condition can be restored. Furthermore, as the younger generation, we are encouraged to take eco-friendly steps in our daily lives, such as using public transportation and conserving electricity.</p>
